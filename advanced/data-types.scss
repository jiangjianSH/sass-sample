/*
  SassScript supports eight data types:

  1. numbers (e.g. 1.2, 13, 10px)
  2. strings of text, with and without quotes (e.g. "foo", 'bar', baz)
  3. colors (e.g. blue, #04a3f9, rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5))
  4. booleans (e.g. true, false)
  5. nulls (e.g. null)
  6. lists of values, separated by spaces or commas (e.g. 1.5em 1em 0 2em, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif)
  7. maps from one value to another (e.g. (key1: value1, key2: value2))
  8. function references

  SassScript also supports all other types of CSS property value, such as Unicode ranges and !important declarations. However, it has no special handling for these types. They're treated just like unquoted strings.
